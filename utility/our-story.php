                        <h2>A Brief History of TRS</h2>
                        <div class="ourStory-short">
                            <p><strong>The Retrofit Source is more than the world's largest supplier of high-end automotive lighting upgrades.</strong> We're a group of enthusiasts with a passion for perfecting your night-time driving experience. From humble beginnings to our current 15,000 square foot facility that's always stocked with an unbeatable selection of headlight happiness, our roots have nearly doubled in size annually since opening in 2005. Our goal is to supply you with the best performing headlight upgrades that have been tailored to fit your application, at a price that works within budget. This is an upgrade for those who are serious about the looks and performance of their vehicle. If you're looking for the cheapest or easiest, go elsewhere. TRS carries the most trusted brands in the industry from Morimoto, Philips, Osram and Denso, so we have something that will meet every need except for the one to compromise. Nobody can match our knowledge base and personalized customer support, and If you're unsure where to start; our team is always here to help. We've partnered up with over 500 authorized distributors all over the world and have served well over 100,000 individuals ourselves. </p>
                            <p><strong>Years ago there were no formal sources for retrofitting components.</strong> You would have to get a damaged headlight off of eBay or from a salvage yard, extract all the parts from it yourself and design and put together your own wire harness. There were no guarantees on the internal or working condition of these parts, and they were expensive too. You want a a set of OEM [plastic] projector shrouds from a BMW E46? $200. A set of OEM clear lenses? That'll be another two bills. You haven't even purchased the core components for the retrofit yet. How about some Acura TL projectors? 300 bucks. Decent condition used OEM ballasts and Philips light bulbs: $200 please and thank you sir.</p>
                            <p><strong>And thus, The Retrofit Source was born in June of 2005.</strong></p> 
                            <p>Originally specializing in collecting and supplying the hard-to-find HID headlight retrofit components, we started out as a company who purchased and recycled slightly damaged headlight assemblies in bulk from salvage yards around the US. Everything salvageable was cleaned, tested and sold; only to realize road-use once again in a retrofit. Eventually we developed our own purpose-built lineup of parts. Starting with the high-demand parts that could be used across the board such as our E46-Replica shrouds or ZKW-Replica lenses, they were an instant hit. Offering OEM-like performance on an aftermarket budget, we expanded the lineup to include other necessities such as ballasts, bulbs, wire harnesses, and of course projectors. All of these components are designed and manufactured exclusively for TRS under our house brand known as Morimoto. Though we believe Morimoto parts offer the best bang for the buck, we also other well respected brands like Koito, Stanley, Philips, Osram, Denso, and Matsushita.</p>
                        
							<p>We truly believed that everybody without a retrofit didn't know what they were missing. By significantly lowering prices, creating a single source for all required components, and educating those who gave us the chance, we were on a mission. In 2010, The Retrofit Source adopted the HIDplanet forum under our umbrella and ever since, the forum has been more alive with active posters, new members, and an avid group of great moderators.</p>
							<p>Was it being in the right place at the right time that got us here? Is it the "no let-downs allowed" attitude in our customer service? Maybe the parts just sell themselves? Whatever it is, it's amazing how much we've accomplished since opening up shop in 2005. The Retrofit Source currently collaborates with over 15 various manufacturers, all of the most professional retrofitting shops here in the US, and has served tens of thousands of individuals worldwide. We are proud to have a prominent customer base in Canada, the Middle East, the UK and Australia. The Retrofit Source offers the absolute best when it comes to HID headlight retrofitting. We will make every customer happy without exception to uphold the reputation that we've worked so hard to build. Our goal was, still is, and always will be to supply our clients with the most appropriate and highest performing parts for their application at the best price.</p>
							<p>Whether you're just getting started by dealing with our excellent customer service or you're already comfortably cruising on that dark road at night, you'll be glad you dealt with The Retrofit Source.</p> 
							<p>Huge thanks to all who give us the pleasure of serving you!</p>
							<p>Yours truly,</p>
