                        	<h4>What is our return policy?</h4>
                            <p>Due to the nature of our products, TRS does not accept returns on open-box HID bulbs. Other parts may be returned if they are in like-new condition with their original unopened packaging. All returns must be made within 45 days and will be subject to a 20% restocking fee without exception. If the kit you ordered will not fit your application, we will gladly accept it back in exchange for full credit towards any other item from our store. Due to the high volume of incoming and outgoing packages each day, If no return form is included: we cannot guarantee that your return will be processed until contact is made and proof of delivery (ie tracking information) is furnished.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What is our exchange policy?</h4>
                            <p>Parts may be exchanged if they are in like-new condition with their original unopened packaging for credit towards anything else in-stock. Exchanges must be made within 60 days of the original purchase date. For example, you ordered projector "X" but changed your mind and now want to use projector "Y." If your returned part(s) cannot be restocked as "new" we reserve to right to deny the exchange or apply only a partial credit towards your new items (no more than 20% reduction in value.)</p>
                            
                            <h4>What is our refund policy?</h4>
                            <p>If you return an item for a refund, it must first meet the criteria stated in our above returns policy. If the item is received within 45 days from the original purchase date, we will issue a refund back to the original payment source. After 45 days from the original purchase date, we can only issue store credit.</p>
                            
                            <h4>How are shipping costs handled on returns/exchanges?</h4>
                            <p>The customer is responsible for shipping costs to and from our shop. However, if the exchange is necessary because of our mistake, we will cover all shipping charges involved. Free shipping coupons are not valid on any exchange. If you used a free shipping promotion on your original order and returned that order for a refund or exchange; that promotion is then forfeited and the actual shipping costs will be deducted from the refund/store credit granted.</p>
                            
                            <h4>How can I cancel my order?</h4>
                            <p>You must call us before the order status is changed to "shipped." Once the order status is marked as shipped, the products have already left our facility. Please beware that due to our e-mail volume, we can only guarantee cancellation requests will be fulfilled if they are called in. Once an order is shipped out, we can only refund any balance left after the shipping costs are paid to the carrier. Special Orders cannot be cancelled, they are placed by your commitment to the purchase. </p>

                        <h2>Warranties</h2>
                        	<h4>What is the warranty on my parts?</h4>
                            <p>Please refer to the products listing page for specific warranty information, as it varies depending on the brand, configuration, etc. All warranties are non-transferrable and are only applicable to the original purchaser.</p>
                            
                            <h4>How can I get a replacement for something that failed?</h4>
                            <p>Please troubleshoot by switching components from side to side to isolate the problem. If your light doesn't work anymore; the ballast, bulb, or wire harness may be faulty. Once you are 100% sure which component failed, you will not have to return it to us for a replacement. You will be asked to send in an image with the wires on the part cut and the serial number visible. A new part will be issued within 24 hours. In special cases, we won't require you to permanently disable the part before a replacement is sent (ie if a light bulb is mis-colored).</p>
                            
                            <h4>How are warranty replacements shipped?</h4>
                            <p>Shipments of replacement parts will be made by USPS First Class Mail and will be paid for by The Retrofit Source. If you are outside of the US and First Class mail is not an available option, you will be required to pay only the shipping costs involved to deliver your replacement part. There is no charge for the replacement part itself. If the customer desires any other shipping method (ie overnight) then they will be responsible for the associated costs.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What if something is missing from my order?</h4>
                            <p>If you believe that an item is missing from your order; please help by e-mailing us a picture of the contents of your package, and the included packing slip. We will work together with you to help make sure you receive the correct/missing parts right away. Any missing items must be reported within 30 days of delivery, beyond that - we will not be responsible for such parts or any associated costs to deliver them.</p>

                        <h2>Shipping</h2>
                        	<h4>Does TRS offer shipping outside the US?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, we offer shipping to every country world-wide. For a shipping quote, please create an account and proceed through the checkout process on our website. Before you submit an order or provide any billing information, the website will display shipping options. We have many customers in Canada, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the UK, Asia, and Australia.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What shipping options are available, how long will delivery take?</h4>
                            <p>We offer shipping by UPS and the US Postal Service. UPS offers guaranteed transit times for their overnight and expedited services. USPS offers estimated transit times for their Express and Priority mail services, but no guaranteed delivery times. Refund requests for delayed delivery can be submitted for UPS only, and will be denied for USPS shipping. Once a package leaves our shop, we make no guarantees on the transit time as it is completely out of our control at that point. These rules apply for both US/Domestic and international shipments.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Where do the parts ship from?</h4>
                            <p>All kits are shipped from our shop in Atlanta, GA. Orders generally ship within 24 hours. Our cutoff time for same day shipping is 12pm EST. If you call in an order with expedited shipping, we will extend our shipping cutoff time to 3pm EST.</p>
                            
                            <h4>I want my shipment insured, what are my options?</h4>
                            <p>UPS shipments are automatically insured for $100 within the Domestic US. USPS shipments do not have any insurance by default. If you would like your package insured for its full value, you must add shipping insurance on the shipping option screen during checkout. With insurance, you will be covered against damage, loss, or any delivery related issues. If no insurance is added and you selected UPS shipping, you will only be covered for $100. If no insurance is added and you selected USPS shipping, unfortunately we won't be able to help assist you with any claims. Packages will be insured by TRS to handle claims directly.</p>
                            
                            <h4>When I track my order online, it only says "billing information received" - what does this mean?</h4>
                            <p>The USPS tracking number system is not very accurate, so even if an item has been shipped, their system may not recognize the tracking information immediately. UPS tracking information should show an update the night it was picked up.</p>
                            
                            <h4>My tracking number says "delivered" but I do not have my item, what can I do?</h4>
                            <p>Please contact the carrier with any questions about delivery problems. All shipping labels are generated electronically according to the address information given with your order. We are not liable for lost or stolen items unless shipping insurance was added. We will gladly assist our customer if there is a problem in any way we can though.</p>
                            
                            <h4>When eligible for free shipping on an order, am I free to choose what service is used?</h4>
                            <p>No, TRS reserves the right to default to any different shipping method if your order used a promo for free shipping. Free shipping offers/coupons are not applicable to any customers outside of the US. If you must have an order shipped using a specific carrier/method, then no shipping coupons should be applied.</p>

                            <p>Please e-mail or call us as soon as possible. There is either missing information required to fulfill your order or a discrepancy in the billing and shipping information that needs to be verified before your order can be shipped.</p>
