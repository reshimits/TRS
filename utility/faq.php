                        <h2>General Questions</h2>
                        	<h4>What is a Retrofit?</h4>
                            <p>Power is nothing without control. Retrofitting is the process of installing a xenon or bi-xenon projector into a reflector based halogen headlight. It is the best HID headlight upgrade possible since the projector will control the light into a properly dispersed, non-glaring beam pattern.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What kits are compatible with my car?</h4>
                            <p>Because of the wide variety of products we sell, there may be just one or a few different options for each application. We do not list what fits what for this reason. If you are unsure what will work best for you, please contact us at <a href="tel:404-220-7940" class="tel">404.220.7940</a> or through the <a href="#">Contact</a> page for a personalized recommendation. Our buyers guide is also a great tool to use for reference.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Does TRS offer retrofitting services?</h4>
                            <p>Please visit our <a href="#">Recommended Retrofitters</a> page to find an installer. We can aid in coordinating a turn-key retrofit for you with one of our professional retrofitting affiliates. TRS concentrates on the development and supply of parts, but does not offer retrofitting services in house.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Where can I find installation instructions?</h4>
                            <p>We have videos and PDFs available for download in our Education &amp;Resources area on the <a href="#">DIY Installation Guides</a> page. If you're having trouble with an installation, please <a href="#">contact us</a> or a professional for help before continuing.</p>
                            
                            <h4>I sent an inquiry through the Contact page, how soon can I expect a reply?</h4>
                            <p>Emails are replied to in the order they are received Monday through Friday. We generally receive between 100-200 new emails everyday and make an effort to reply on the next business day. Because each customer's questions deserve personalized answers, sometimes it may take up to two business days to receive a reply, especially after the weekend. For an immediate answer to your question, please call us at <a href="tel:404-220-7940" class="tel">404.220.7940</a>.</p>
                            
                            <h4>How do I become a dealer for The Retrofit Source?</h4>
                            <p>We offer wholesale pricing on two different tiers for resellers and installers. We also offer drop-shipping services for companies who don't wish to carry an inventory of our parts. You must provide a resellers certificate and or tax-id number to be eligible. Please download a copy of our <a href="#">Reseller's Agreement</a>, fill out all information and return it to us or simply <a href="#">contact us</a> for more information.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What is the Morimoto brand and why can't I find any information on them?</h4>
                            <p>Morimoto is our house brand of high quality retrofitting components that have been engineered to OEM-strict specs. We will only add an item to the Morimoto line if it passes stringent quality control standards and will last, look, and perform as well as a high-end OEM brand such as Philips or Denso. If you want a set of $20 "eBay special" ballasts or bulbs that will burn out next week, go ahead and waste your money now. The Morimoto parts cost significantly more to produce in the first place, and although you'll pay more for them compared to generic, you also save considerably over the OEM's we sell and still get the same quality.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Who owns the rights to all of the Morimoto products?</h4>
                            <p>Morimoto is a US trademark owned by The Retrofit Source Inc. Any unauthorized sellers promoting their products under this moniker are liable to face legal action under infringement on US Trademark law. Please note that knock-off's of our products do exist, and if the part does not contain the Morimoto logo hard-cast onto it's body, it is not genuine. Please help us by reporting any products being advertised by other sellers as Morimoto parts.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Can I re-use my HID kit with a retrofit?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, you can use our AMP/D2S ballast adapters to convert your existing HID kit ballasts to be compatible with D2S bulbs (which is the bulb type that all of our projectors require) We've also got PNP to Projector Retrofit kits pre-bundled with everything one would need to upgrade.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What parts do I need for a retrofit?</h4>
                            <p>Projectors, ballasts, bulbs, and a wire harness are essential. We also recommend a set of shrouds/bezels to enhance the finished looks as well as a clear lens upgrade if applicable.</p>

                        <h2>Projector Questions</h2>
                        	<h4>What kind of projectors do I need for my car?</h4>
                            <p>There are no projectors designed specifically your Dodge Stratus, Honda Civic, Toyota Tundra etc. Retrofitting is the process of taking a projector system and simply making it fit into your housings. There will be cutting and other custom work involved in the process, and though you do have a variety of options available for compatible parts- there are limitations due to size in some applications (ie fitting an LS430 or Q45 projector into a new Civic is not going to work). Best answer here, if you are unsure - <a href="#">contact us.</a></p>
                            
                            <h4>When starting a retrofit, is it better to use aftermarket "projector" style headlights?</h4>
                            <p>Generally, upgrading aftermarket projector style headlights can go one of two ways: it can either be much easier than retrofitting a set of OEM style reflector headlights or significantly harder. If the headlights are designed with removable projectors that can simply be unscrewed and cleanly removed, the conversion would be relatively easy. If the headlights are designed so that the existing projector is integrated (in one piece) with other internals (like the bracket that holds the high beam reflector, the aiming adjuster mounts, etc) then the process will be a bit harder. Because of the unpredictable nature of these aftermarket projector style housings, we usually end up recommending the customer to retrofit their OEM housings and cover the projectors with a nice set of shrouds/bezels for a clean finished look.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What are the main differences between the Mini H1 and Mini D2S projectors?</h4>
                            <p>â€“ <u>Beam uniformity:</u> The Mini D2S is a bit better in this category, with slightly more even-ness in its output. 
							<br>â€“ <u>Beam Width:</u> The Mini H1 is slightly wider here (just barely) 
							<br>â€“ <u>High beam performance:</u> The Mini D2S has a brighter, more defined high beam (bi-xenon) output 
							<br>â€“ <u>Cutoff color/sharpness:</u> Both projectors have clear lenses, which gives them a sharp and colorful cutoff line. The curved cutoff shield inside the Mini H1 projector results in slightly more color, however. 
							<br>â€“ <u>Bulb type used:</u> Obviously the H1 takes H1 and D2S takes D2S, and we feel that D2S bulbs offer a bit more precision, though no more light since they use the same light producing capsule. 
							<br>â€“ <u>Size:</u> The D2S version is about 1/2" shorter in overall depth, but is also slightly wider and a little bit taller than the H1 version. 
							<br>â€“ <u>Modification to your OEM housing:</u> the diameter of the mounting shaft on the H1 is 22mm, whereas it's 32mm on the D2S model, so unless you have an H4 headlight, you will likely have to widen up the bulb hole by a bit to use the Mini D2S projector. The Mini D2S was designed for reflectors using H4/9003 bulbs but is still definitely usable in other applications.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Between the Acura TL and FX-R bi-xenon projector, which one is better?</h4>
                            <p>â€“ It's true that these are two of the best bi-xenon projectors in terms of overall performance, yes. 
							<br>â€“ Low beam performance: The two projectors are nearly identical as far as beam uniformity. 
							<br>â€“ The cutoff on the FX-R is significantly sharper than a TL is out of the box since it has the clear lens already installed. You can achieve similar sharpness and color with the TL but it will take some work and extra money to get the ZKW-R lenses 
							<br>â€“ The size of the TLs makes the slightly harder to retrofit than the FX-Rs, and their big bi-xenon solenoid makes them next to impossible to completely cover with a shroud. 
							<br>â€“ FX-R is cheaper, by about $65. Winner in our opinion: The FX-R.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What is the difference between an FX-R projector and the OEM FX35 projectors?</h4>
                            <p>FX-R projectors are brand new, aftermarket projectors that have been designed specifically for the purpose of a custom headlight retrofit. They're slightly smaller, have mounting holes conveniently cast into the corners of their body, and have the clear lens upgrade already done to them. They're ready for retrofitting right out of the box. The FX35/45 bi-xenons are used OEM parts that have been removed from an Infiniti FX SUV. They're also good performing projectors, but need a bit of trimming before being retrofit-ready, and do not come with the clear lenses pre-installed and optimized. Output wise, many retrofitters consider the FX-R's to be better for both low and high beam characteristics.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Between the Morimoto Mini and FX-R, which one should I use?</h4>
                            <p>As far as the installation goes, the FX-R will require permanent modification to your headlights, but if you're a DIY kinda guy, It should not take more than a long afternoon to get the job done right. On the other hand, the Morimoto Mini Bi-Xenons are awesome for those looking for a much easier yet still effective upgrade - since they don't typically require any cutting/mods to install. They have a threaded shaft on the back-side that goes through the pre-existing hole in your reflector (where the light bulb comes through now) and holds tight with a threaded lock-ring and some other included hardware.</p>
							<p>So basically if you are looking for maximum performance and don't mind getting your hands a bit dirty on the retrofit, the FX-R is my recommendation. If you want to get 80% of the performance and prefer a much easier installation, the Morimoto Mini setup is the way to go</p>
                            
                            <h4>What are "value" or "factory direct" Morimoto Mini projectors?</h4>
                            <p>The projectors that we sell for 50%-off projectors are basically factory direct projectors that we don't take the time to inspect, test, or adjust for perfect cutoffs. They can be adjusted easily to perform as they should or may not need any adjustment at all. Because of this, they will not come with any warranty. Since they're not on our site, we can accept an order for these through email or over the phone.</p>
                            
                            <h4>If my car has one bulb for low and high beam, what kind of projector should I use?</h4>
                            <p>To retain full functionality of your low/high beams and the ability to "flash" the headlights - you must use a bi-xenon projector in this case.</p>
                            
                            <h4>My bi-xenon solenoid is not working, what do I do?</h4>
                            <p>We recommend checking a few things including the connection to the solenoid and the order of the pins in the input socket on your wire harness to ensure they're wired up properly. If the solenoid is sticking or trying to pull the shield down, the projector should be disassembled and the assembly tweaked to allow for full movement. We recommend testing the solenoids before final installation to avoid having to take apart your retrofit.</p>
                            
                            <h4>My projectors have 2 red wires, which one is the positive and which one is the ground?</h4>
                            <p>It does not make a difference; the solenoid should work regardless of how you wire them. Most bi-xenon solenoids are not polarity sensitive, but if they are â€“ the color code to their wiring should be easily verified (red or yellow = positive, black or brown = ground, etc).</p>
                            
                            <h4>What is the difference between LHD and RHD projectors?</h4>
                            <p>LHD projectors are designed for use in countries such as North America where oncoming traffic drives on the left side of us. RHD projectors are designed for use in countries such as the UK or Australia where oncoming traffic drives on the right side of us. The difference is in the beam pattern emitted from the projector: LHD projectors produce a beam that is lower on the left side and higher on the right side to maximize down the road visibility while avoiding glare to oncoming traffic. The shape of the beam is opposite for RHD projectors of course.</p>

                        <h2>Ballast Questions</h2>
                        	<h4>Should I use 55w ballasts?</h4>
                            <p>55 watt ballasts will provide you with more light intensity compared to conventional 35w system, however that comes with added heat and less reliability. If you are willing to sacrifice these things for a little more light, we do have a 55w ballast option available. However, TRS typically recommends going with a 35w setup for better reliability, less heat, and still more than enough light output when coupled with high performance projectors and good quality bulbs. All OEM applications use 35w.</p>
                    </div> 
                    <div class="allAboutTRS-section">            		
                        <h2>Bulb Questions</h2>
                        	<h4>What is the difference between 3000K, 4300K, 5000K, 6000K bulbs?</h4>
                            <p>3000K is a golden yellow color, best for use in poor weather conditions. 4300K is a slightly off white, 5000K is pure white, and 6000K has a slight tinge of blue. All OEM applications use 4300K bulbs. As you move up the Kelvin scale, your lumen rating will drop a bit, this is why we do not recommend or sell bulbs over 6000K.</p>
                            
                            <h4>I want the brightest output, what Kelvin rating for the bulbs should I choose?</h4>
                            <p>4300K -there is an inverse relationship here, so as the K (Kelvin) rating goes up, the Lumen rating goes down. It is a common misconception that K is a measure of intensity/brightness - that is completely false. It is only a measure of the color temperature.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What is the difference between Philips and Morimoto bulbs?</h4>
                            <p>They're both brand new, high quality D2S bulbs that can be used in a high performance retrofit. When shopping for a D2S bulb, it's important to consider a couple main things. A) The precision in the alignment of the capsule, and B) the mixture of the halide salts used in that capsule. Both the Philips and Morimoto bulbs use a metal base frame to ensure the glass capsule is aligned in precisely the correct position inside your projector, not tilted up/down or side/side. This will translate to a beam pattern that is in focus to maximize the performance potential of your setup. Second, the mixture of halide salts used inside the Philips and Morimoto bulbs is very similar - which translates to both model's excellent reliability rating , and consistency in their luminosity and Kelvin rating.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Can I use 35w Morimoto or Philips bulbs with 55w ballasts?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, it will work fine but the life expectancy of the bulb will be slightly reduced, but most likely by a very marginal amount. When doing so, we will only honor the warranty on these bulbs if they are used with our Morimoto 5Five ballasts. The other side effect of using a 35w HID bulb with a 50w ballast is the Kelvin rating will drop one notch, so a 6000K will look more like a 5000K, for example.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What are the alcohol pads that are included with the light bulbs for?</h4>
                            <p>You should thoroughly clean your HID bulbs before finally installing them into the projectors. Wipe the glass, return wire, and base clean of any contaminants such as dust, finger prints, etc. This will help ensure their longevity and the performance of your setup.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What is the difference between Philips 85122 and 85122+ bulbs?</h4>
                            <p>Each vendor has their own opinion (or BS story really) on what the difference is between 85122 and 85122+ bulbs. Let TRS put this mystery to an end once and for all:85122 is Philips' older version of the 85122+ - it is not as bright and is more prone to what's known as color shifting. 85122+ has 300 more lumens to start with (its brighter) and is less prone to color shifting. Color shifting means that as the bulb ages, it will not only change from a slightly off-white 4300K color temperature to a more bluish 5000K color, but it will also lose some of its luminosity (it will dim)both start life as a 4300K bulb, so when new will look the same on the road. After use for about a year, the 85122 will be more whitish/blue and lose a bit of intensity, whereas the 85122+ will stay in "like new" condition for longer. Interestingly, Philips has recently re-named the 85122+ back to the standard 85122, but kept all the updated features.</p>

                        <h2>Wiring Harness Questions</h2>
                        	<h4>Why is there only one input connection on my relay wire harness?</h4>
                            <p>This is normal, as your factory output socket is now only used to trigger the relay control box to turn on the low/high beams and not actually power the headlights. There is virtually no strain on your factory harness, and you should simply tape off and tuck away the other output. Please check our <a href="#">DIY Installation Guides</a> for details.</p>
                            
                            <h4>If my car uses an H7, 9006, H11, H4 (etc) bulb, how is it possible to use projectors that are made for D2S bulbs?</h4>
                            <p>There are a couple intermediary components that convert your original headlight sockets to be compatible with your new xenon or bi-xenon projectors. First, a relay wire harness will plug into your existing headlight output socket. You should specify your original halogen bulb type when buying a harness. When you turn on your headlights, the relay harness will click on - drawing power from the car battery and sending it out to the HID ballasts. These ballasts will have outputs that will twist onto and ignite the D2S bulbs.</p>
                            
                            <h4>If I have a separate halogen high beam bulb in my housing, can I still use a bi-xenon? How would I wire it?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, though you technically only need a low beam projector (like a TSX, RX, or S2K-R) you can still use a bi-xenon projector. This way, you will have both a HID high beam and your original halogen high beam that will work together when the stalk inside the car is pulled. To wire it, you should simply run the 2 wires (+/-) that come out of the back of the projector over to the halogen high beam side of your housing and use some of our high beam splitters to divert power from your halogen high beam bulbs into the solenoid too.</p>

                        <h2>Shrouds &amp; Lenses Questions</h2>
                        	<h4>What is the difference between "value" and "premium" shrouds and clear lenses?</h4>
                            <p>Value items will have a couple very minor surface imperfections such as a tiny scratch or scuff. These defects are purely cosmetic, and will not affect the performance or usability of that part at all, guaranteed. Perfectionists will appreciate the strict quality control, as only pristine parts pass for "premium."</p>

                        <h2>Installation Questions</h2>
                        	<h4>When installing projectors, what side should be on the bottom?</h4>
                            <p>The light cutoff shield should be on the bottom. The aspheric projector lens reverses the image of light onto the road, so the open half inside the projector should actually go on top. As a simple rule of thumb for all bixenons, the solenoid goes on the bottom.</p>
                            
                            <h4>How do I install my CCFL or LED Angel Eyes?</h4>
                            <p>Typically there are two popular methods for installing our angel eyes. You can either use a few dabs of clear silicone glue to literally stick the CCFL ring to the shroud. The silicone should dry perfectly clear, which will be hard to notice from more than a foot away. A second, more reliable method involves drilling several tiny holes around the face of the shroud and then threading the CCFL ring onto it using some very thin metal wire or even tooth floss. It is recommended that you use the smallest diameter drill bit available to do this. Please check our <a href="#">DIY Installation Guides</a> for details.</p>
                            
                            <h4>How do I attach the shrouds to my projectors?</h4>
                            <p>Most retrofitters including lots of professional shops use either JB weld epoxy or clear silicone glue to permanently affix the shrouds to their projectors. Both do well at resisting heat, but the silicone stays flexible, will not crack over time from vibrations etc like JB weld might. While the centric rings help make fitting the shrouds much easier, you should also use glue in between them to ensure things don't come lose over time. Please check our <a href="#">DIY Installation Guides</a> for details.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What tools are necessary to perform a retrofit?</h4>
                            <p>You will need basic hand tools such as flat blade/Philips screw drivers, a Dremel or other rotary tool with a variety of cutting/smoothing attachments, a heat source like an oven or a heat gun, some free time, your brain, your hands, and a variety of other misc materials that can be sourced from the local hardware store like nuts/bolts, epoxies etc.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Can you give me some tips on opening and resealing headlights?</h4>
                            <p>â€“ Opening the headlights: is not terribly difficult - you'll just want to take all the hardware off the outside of the housing including the few screws that are around the perimeter of the light, put it in the middle rack in your oven for 7 minutes (preheated to 265 degrees) and then pry it apart using a couple flat blade screw drivers. You'll want to use some work gloves, as it will be quite warm/hot when it comes out of course. 
							<br>â€“ Resealing them: we usually recommend just re-heating the headlights using the same combo of time/heat as when you took them apart, and then just pushing the two halves back together and using some small clamps to hold them that way until it cools down and the glue hardens again. From there, if a small gap remains you can just squeeze a bead of silicone or latex caulk in between the front/back half and smooth it out with your finger. This will give you a perfect seal again.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What's the best way to set the aim on my new headlights?</h4>
                            <p>Parked 25 feet from a wall, the steps in the beam pattern should be the same distance apart on that wall as the projectors are in your cars headlights. So if you measure the distance between the projectors in the headlights and its 4.5 feet, the steps should be 4.5 feet apart. This will ensure maximum width without compromising the intensity in the center of the beam.</p> 
							<p>The height: again at 25 feet away, your beam pattern should light up just below the side view mirrors on a normal passenger car. This will ensure maximum distance lighting without compromising the glare to oncoming traffic.</p>
